/* where it will store the .jar file after executing this command ./gradlew installDist


After executing the command ./gradlew installDist, the generated .jar file will typically be stored in the build/install/<project-name>/lib directory, where <project-name> is the name of your project.

Here's a breakdown of the directory structure:

    build: This is the directory where Gradle stores all build-related output.
    install: This directory is created by the installDist task.
    <project-name>: This is the name of your project, typically specified in your settings.gradle file.
    lib: This directory contains the .jar files produced by your project.

For example, if your project is named my-application, the .jar file generated by the installDist task will be located at build/install/my-application/lib.

You can use this .jar file for deployment, distribution, or further processing as needed for your project.
